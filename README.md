# Qr-code-for-laser-cut
An important description of the experience for using qr code for laser cutting.  

**I consider it important to add qr code to ready-made models, organically fitting them into the design, as far as possible, because this will help other users repeat your project, modify it, understand how and why to use it, as well as in case of a breakdown, understand how to fix it, spending the least amount of time on what you have already invented**  

In  [Organizer-for-a-drill-parts-poject](https://github.com/m2415146/Organizer-for-a-drill-parts) , I had the need to use qr code for laser cutting. at the moment, I am using a combination of creating a surface in the rhinoceros program, further exporting to .dxf format and further adapting for cutting in the CorelDRAW program  

it turned out that inserting QR into RHino, as well as into CorelDRAW itself, is not such an easy task. QR can be created using various services - for example, such:
[QR code generator](http://qrcoder.ru/?t=1/)

but when you try to import it into rhino, it is inserted as a simple picture, which is not suitable for uploading to CorelDraw for laser cutting. Also, if you insert it into CorelDraw itself, you will encounter problems.  

It may looks like this:

I also tried using a QR code generator for 3D printing ( [QR code 2 stl](https://printer.tools/qrcode2stl/#shareQR-eyJ0ZXh0IjoiaHR0cHM6Ly9naXRodWIuY29tL20yNDE1MTQ2L09yZ2FuaXplci1mb3ItYS1kcmlsbC1wYXJ0cyJ9) )   - you get a stl model that looks like this in CorelDraw:

I also found a plugin for RHino that generates a QR code, but I couldnâ€™t figure out how to use it  [QR Rhino](https://www.food4rhino.com/en/resource/qr-code-generator)   

I want to test the qr code generator in the CorelDRAW program for this task
